## Introduction

### Objectives

This case study aims to model the probability of attrition of each employee from the HR Analytics Dataset, [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lnvardanyan/hr-analytics). Its conclusions will allow the management to understand which factors urge the employees to leave the company and which changes should be made to avoid their departure.
